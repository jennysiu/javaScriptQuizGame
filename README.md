## Description

Welcome to our JavaScript Coding Quiz Game, designed to test and enhance your knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals. As a coding boot camp student, this game offers you an engaging and interactive way to gauge your progress and compare your skills with your peers. This browser-based application features a dynamic user interface, with HTML and CSS elements that are updated in real time through JavaScript.


## Features

### Start the Challenge
Interactive Start Button: Begin your quiz journey with a simple click of the Start button. This action triggers the start of a countdown timer and displays the first quiz question.

### Quiz Mechanics
- Multiple-Choice Questions: Each question in the quiz is a multiple-choice query, with a set of answer buttons for you to choose from.
- Sequential Question Display: Upon selecting an answer, the next question in the series automatically appears,  keeping the quiz flow smooth and engaging.
- Time Penalty for Incorrect Answers: Choose your answers wisely! Incorrect answers will result in a time penalty, reducing the remaining time on the quiz clock.

### Wrapping Up
End of Quiz: The quiz concludes either when you've answered all the questions or when the timer reaches zero.
Score Display and Saving: At the end of the quiz, your score is displayed. You also have the option to save your initials along with your score, allowing you to track your performance over time and compare it with your peers.
